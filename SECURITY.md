# Matrix Language Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report privately
Send a detailed report to the maintainers privately:
- **Email**: [security@matrix-lang.org](mailto:security@matrix-lang.org) (if available)
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

### 3. Include detailed information
When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish?
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected?
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### 4. Example report template
```
**Summary**: Brief description of the vulnerability

**Details**: Detailed explanation of the issue

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

**Impact**: Description of what an attacker could achieve

**Affected Versions**: List of affected versions

**Suggested Mitigation**: Your suggestions for fixing the issue
```

## Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Detailed assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix development**: Depends on complexity, typically 1-4 weeks
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is available and deployed

## Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning
Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
- **cargo-audit**: Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **cargo-deny**: Enforces security policies for dependencies
- **Dependency updates**: Weekly automated dependency updates
- **License compliance**: Ensures only approved licenses are used

### Secure Development Practices
- All dependencies are vetted for security
- Regular security audits of the codebase
- Principle of least privilege in code design
- Input validation and sanitization
- Memory safety through Rust's ownership system

### Supply Chain Security
- Dependencies are pinned to specific versions
- Only trusted crate registries are allowed
- Regular updates to address security advisories
- License compliance checking

## Known Security Considerations

As a programming language implementation, Matrix Language has several security considerations:

### 1. Code Execution
Matrix Language executes user-provided code. When using the interpreter:
- **Sandboxing**: Consider running in a sandboxed environment
- **Resource limits**: Be aware that code execution can consume system resources
- **File system access**: The language may have file system access capabilities

### 2. Memory Safety
- Matrix Language is implemented in Rust, providing memory safety guarantees
- However, unsafe code blocks or C FFI could introduce vulnerabilities
- Physics simulation code involves complex calculations that should be validated

### 3. Dependency Security
The project depends on various crates:
- GUI libraries (egui, eframe)
- Math libraries (nalgebra)
- Parsing libraries (logos)
- ECS systems (bevy_ecs)

All dependencies are regularly audited and updated.

### 4. GPU and Hardware Access
Future versions may include:
- GPU compute capabilities
- Direct hardware access for physics simulation
- These features will require additional security considerations

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using Matrix Language:

1. **Validate input**: Always validate code input from untrusted sources
2. **Resource limits**: Implement appropriate resource limits for code execution
3. **Sandboxing**: Consider running Matrix Language in a containerized or sandboxed environment
4. **Regular updates**: Keep Matrix Language updated to the latest version
5. **Network isolation**: If not needed, run without network access

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security report:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and assess the report
3. **Coordination**: We will work with the reporter to understand and reproduce the issue
4. **Fix development**: We will develop and test a fix
5. **Coordinated disclosure**: We will coordinate with the reporter on disclosure timing
6. **Public release**: We will release the fix and publish a security advisory
7. **Credit**: We will credit the reporter (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Hall of Fame

We appreciate security researchers who help keep Matrix Language secure:

<!-- This section will be updated when we receive legitimate security reports -->
*No security issues have been reported yet.*
