# Unity-Style Viewport Improvements

## Summary of Changes Made

### ✅ **1. Simplified View Mode System**
- **Before**: Confusing Game2D/Game3D buttons alongside Scene2D/Scene3D
- **After**: Clean 2D/3D toggle with optional "Game" view overlay
- **Impact**: Much clearer interface, similar to Unity's layout

### ✅ **2. Enhanced Grid System**
- **Before**: Identical 2D and 3D grids (both looked like flat 2D grids)
- **After**:
  - **2D Mode**: Clean orthogonal grid with colored X/Y axes
  - **3D Mode**: Perspective grid with depth cues, 3D coordinate axes, and visual depth indicators
- **Impact**: Clear visual distinction between 2D and 3D editing modes

### ✅ **3. Fixed Animation/Simulation Rubber-banding**
- **Before**: Objects snapped back to original positions when simulation stopped
- **After**: Object transforms persist when simulation is stopped
- **Impact**: Can now move objects manually and they stay in place when stopping simulation

### ✅ **4. Improved Toolbar Layout**
- **Before**: Cluttered with confusing buttons
- **After**:
  - Simple 2D/3D toggle with smart camera positioning
  - "Simulation" controls (Play/Pause/Stop/Reset Scene)
  - Reset Scene button that properly resets both camera and scene state
  - Camera follow toggle for selected objects
- **Impact**: Much more intuitive and Unity-like workflow

### ✅ **5. Enhanced Camera System**
- **Before**: Camera didn't follow object movements
- **After**:
  - Optional camera follow system for selected objects
  - Smooth camera transitions when switching view modes
  - Better camera positioning defaults for 2D vs 3D
- **Impact**: Camera now responds intelligently to object changes

### ✅ **6. Unity-like Visual Indicators**
- **Added**: 3D orientation gizmo in top-right corner (only in 3D mode)
  - Shows X/Y/Z axes with proper colors (Red/Green/Blue)
  - Updates based on camera rotation for spatial awareness
- **Added**: View mode indicator in bottom-left corner
  - Shows current mode: "2D", "3D Scene", or "3D Game"
  - Color-coded for quick identification
- **Impact**: Better spatial awareness and clearer feedback about current view state

### ✅ **7. Enhanced Background Colors**
- **2D Mode**: Darker background for better contrast
- **3D Mode**: Normal background, darker blue when in Game view
- **Impact**: Visual distinction helps understand current mode

### ✅ **8. Improved Gizmo System**
- **3D Mode**: Full XYZ gizmos with proper depth representation
- **2D Mode**: Simplified XY gizmos appropriate for 2D editing
- **Impact**: Context-appropriate editing tools

## Code Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/gui/mod.rs`**: Simplified ViewMode enum (removed Game2D/Game3D)
2. **`src/gui/viewport.rs`**: Major overhaul with all improvements

### Key Functions Added:
- `update_camera_follow()`: Tracks and follows selected object movements
- `draw_orientation_gizmo()`: Unity-like 3D orientation indicator
- `draw_view_mode_indicator()`: Shows current view mode status
- `draw_grid()`: Enhanced with distinct 2D vs 3D rendering

### Key Features:
- **Smart Camera Positioning**: Auto-adjusts camera when switching modes
- **Persistent Transforms**: Objects maintain position when simulation stops
- **Follow System**: Optional camera following of selected objects
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear indicators of current view mode and orientation

## Usage

### View Mode Switching:
- Click **"2D"** for top-down editing with orthogonal grid
- Click **"3D"** for perspective editing with depth-aware grid
- Toggle **"Game"** for game camera preview overlay

### Camera Controls:
- **WASD**: Move camera (context-aware for 2D/3D)
- **Q/E**: Up/down movement (3D only)
- **Arrow Keys**: Rotate camera
- **Mouse Drag**: Pan (2D) or Rotate (3D)
- **Shift + Mouse**: Pan in 3D mode
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom

### Simulation Controls:
- **Play/Pause**: Start/pause animation
- **Stop**: Stop animation and preserve object positions
- **Reset Scene**: Reset both simulation and camera to defaults

### Camera Options:
- **Reset Camera**: Return to default position for current mode
- **Follow**: Toggle camera following of selected objects

## Benefits

1. **Unity-like Experience**: Interface now closely matches Unity's viewport
2. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Always know what mode you're in
3. **Persistent Editing**: Objects stay where you put them
4. **Improved Workflow**: Logical progression from 2D to 3D editing
5. **Better Spatial Awareness**: 3D orientation gizmo and proper grids
6. **Professional Feel**: Cleaner, more intuitive interface

The viewport now provides a much more professional and Unity-like editing experience with clear visual distinctions between 2D and 3D modes, persistent object transforms, and intelligent camera behavior.
